# This file file should be empty of actual config overrides.  It exists because
# the default overrides provded by garethr-docker are not suitable for 18.03+
# on Xenial.
#
# In order to override the default overrides, a template must exist. It is not
# enough (as near as I can tell) to set the override value to undef.
